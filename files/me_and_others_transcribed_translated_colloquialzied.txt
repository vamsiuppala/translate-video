Speaker A: I understand how flies get attracted to honey. I'm familiar with the concept of death lurking around and causing havoc. I'm well-versed in both facts and gossip. I have a lot of knowledge, but not about you, Jean Slavien. This movie encourages you to take a look at yourself from a different perspective. By recognizing yourself in others, you might start reflecting on your own identity. What do we truly understand about ourselves? How does our psychology work? To what extent are we able to form our own opinions independently, and how much are we influenced by others?
Speaker B: Upbeat tunes.
Speaker C: Often, when a new lawyer starts in court or as a prosecutor, they can make some pretty big mistakes. Sometimes, they might rely too much on witness testimonies without questioning them enough. Witnesses are real people who give their accounts, but even in similar situations, they can have vastly different perspectives on what happened. Why? Well, people are prone to making mistakes. It's worth considering how reliable our memories really are and how easily they can be influenced. It's important to question the accuracy of these memories, especially in legal settings.
Speaker B: Yo, five dudes. I thought there were six actually. Three of them had machine guns and three of y'all got snatched. I could've sworn there were seven of them though. Three with machine guns and one with a pistol.
Speaker C: Why did I suddenly vanish from the situation?
Speaker B: I didn't see it happen. I think they just grabbed you suddenly and you vanished right after. It was pretty surprising, like you were covered with a bag or something.
Speaker C: How did that happen? I disappeared.
Speaker B: Nah, nah, you didn't vanish, I did. You've left.
Speaker C: I hightailed it out of there. I reckon three of you got snatched up and taken. They even threw a bag over your noggin before making off with ya.
Speaker B: They took you and just kinda shoved you along.
Speaker A: So, there's this one fact, right? But then everyone's got their own opinions about it. Why do you think that happens?
Speaker B: Three of you got kidnapped.
Speaker C: So, there were like four or five of them, can't say for sure, but I do remember that two dudes had machine guns. They were just standing there blazing away. One of them had on a black hat and a red dress. Take a chill pill, we'll piece it together. So, two of them had machine guns, right? Yep, they were just standing there shooting. Just shooting away. What were the rest of them up to and how many didn't have machine guns? The others came running towards us. There might have been two or three of them, can't say for sure, though. How do you reckon it all went down?
Speaker B: I have no idea.
Speaker C: You're not aware of that?
Speaker B: Oh, I didn't consider that.
Could you please clarify or specify?
Speaker B: Hmm, if they were wearing the same clothes, then maybe.
Speaker C: So, what about clothing?
Speaker B: Yup.
Speaker C also mentioned that there were faces present.
Speaker B: I couldn't remember what they looked like because they were wearing masks.
Speaker C: What kind of hats do you recall?
Speaker A: It all happened really quickly. We were surprised by the shots and it was a lot to take in. Our emotions were all over the place. I can't remember everything clearly, it's all a bit jumbled up. We had to guess and imagine what was going on since we didn't have all the facts.
Speaker C: Can you add anything to what your team told us? Yup, I can add a bit. Go ahead. First off, I was expecting the professor to be safe and unharmed. Makes sense. Weren't you really scared? Nah, not really scared. That should be obvious. Another thing I remember is that you didn't put up much resistance. Usually, someone who's taken forcefully would resist more. And then, I remember one person approaching you first, then others joining in... No, actually, it was the others who came closer first, then one guy followed and did something to you, like covered your mouth or something, sneaking up behind you. Someone was behind you, right? Yeah. And how many were... Was he alone behind you? No, then another person came over. What did they do to me? They tried to... I didn't actually see clearly what they were doing, I wasn't paying much attention, but I noticed they were making some effort, though not a lot. Why? To take me away? Or do they intend to harm me? Yeah, basically to take me away, to remove me from there. So, did they push me from behind to take me away? Or were they pulling me by the hand? How did I disappear from the scene? How did I vanish? I think the other person shooting nearby also pitched in to help them. Helped them out, right? Yup. Did he push me, you think? Yeah, seems like it. I guess he was pushing. I don't think they carried you. I remember them pushing you, but my answers might be off. What do you think? Not really. Are you confident about what you're saying? Yeah, but I didn't really focus on how they took the professor away. Makes sense.
Speaker A: Make sure to consider your own thoughts and opinions as well. That's how it went down.
Speaker B: Oh yeah, I remember one.
Speaker C: Hey, do you remember that one?
Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct.
Could you please jot that down for me?
Speaker B: I'm not sure, I didn't really check out his outfit or shoes. But I did manage to catch a glimpse of his face, even though it was partially covered. It was quite slim, really thin. He was tall. The mask kind of slipped off a bit, and I could recall his facial features.
Speaker C: Can you recall what their face looked like?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Can you tell me who this person is?
Speaker B: I could do that.
Speaker C: How did you recognize him? Have you ever seen him before or after that?
Speaker B: I caught sight of him afterwards.
Speaker C: Where is that?
Speaker B was up on stage wearing a police uniform.
Speaker C: Wait, so someone in a police uniform is here? Can you please bring them over? We had a senior sergeant looking out for us earlier. Hey, senior sergeant, can you come over here for a sec? Can you just stand right here, if that's okay? Is this the person we're talking about?
Speaker B: Yep, this one. Spot on!
Could you elaborate on that point a bit more?
Speaker B: Totally.
Speaker C: I understand.
Speaker B: I guess so.
Speaker C: He didn't kidnap me, so he's not guilty of that. But come on, he was supposed to protect me, not let me get snatched up like that. Could it really be him?
Speaker B: Yeah, I reckon so.
Speaker C: Were you not in this room? You didn't see it? Do you have someone who can confirm that?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Where is he? He's over there. Can you come here, please? Another sergeant is here. Hey, can you stand up, please? Can you confirm that your friend wasn't there during the shooting? Yes, I can confirm. When did you head out to the shoot? At around eight, maybe the start of the ninth. That was after the shooting had already happened. How did you find out about the shooting? Some guys in our circle had already filled us in on the details. Did that information convince you?
Speaker B: No, I don't really care.
Speaker C: You're not buying that he didn't kidnap me, huh?
Speaker B: Nah, I don't buy it.
Person A: So, like, sometimes what we think and what we feel can be kinda off, right? It’s like we know this and without even realizing it, we end up comparing how we see things, what we think, and even how we act with what everyone else is doing. It’s like, we do it without even thinking. We kinda look to other people to figure things out, you know?
Speaker B: Hey, can I have your attention for a sec? Could you all stand up and make your way over here real quick? Sorry to rush you, but we need 20 volunteers for the first experiment. Chop-chop, we're heading to the testing room through this door. So, how many of you are up for it? Let's kick off the experiment now. First volunteer, please step up. Take a look at this photo. This here's a portrait of a real shady character, a dangerous criminal. Your job is to study the picture and give us a psychological profile of this person, mainly focusing on his personality. What do you think about this individual as a person? To me, he comes across as sly and mysterious, you know, all closed off like that. And how can you tell he's cunning? Any specific facial features that give it away, like his eyes? Yep, his eyes scream trickster all the way. Crafty, sneaky, you name it. This guy, I reckon, sees the world in a pretty grim light. Looks like he's got some serious beef with folks around him, right? Does he give off a chilly vibe from his face?
Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty good.
Speaker B: But what makes you think he looks like a criminal?
Speaker C: Look.
Speaker B: Damn, those eyes are ice cold. I'd say this guy is one angry dude, not someone you can count on. And man, he's been through some stuff for sure. Those scars, broken nose, and his face just screams toughness. Years of living hard have etched some serious cruelty and hardness onto his features. That strong chin and rough nose hint at someone who's not to be messed with, more brawn than brains, you know? Those eyes are just plain mean, and his whole expression is tough as nails, and kinda scary. Can't really say anything nice about this guy, to be real with you. Thanks a bunch. Yo, take a seat up front, next to that girl. Next up, come on over. Check out this pic. This is a portrait of a big-time scientist. Your job, Comrade Mishaevtin, is to look at this photo and describe the guy's personality. Now, this is just my take, so take it with a grain of salt. But from the pic, it looks like this dude is hella smart. He's got this intense, penetrating gaze, like he can see right through you. Seems like he's still got a lot of energy, and he comes off as gentle and dependable. Overall, seems like a solid and nice dude. Thanks a ton. Grab a seat up front. Seems like he's super focused and maybe a bit of a jokester. Serious, but with a touch of humor. How's his face? Oh, it's nice. Real nice. Is he a good guy? Yeah, seems like a decent fella. Probably loves kids. Probably a great guy.
Speaker C believes that when he interacts with people who are similar to him, he has a certain charm that helps him persuade them.
Speaker B: A criminal's profile.
Speaker C: You can tell by the way he squints his eyes so boldly.
Speaker B: It looks like even when he's discussing something positive, he still seems to carry a sense of negativity within him. He comes across as a typical scientist, lost in thought. You can tell he puts in a lot of mental effort. He's really dedicated to self-improvement.
Speaker C is saying that he has a high forehead, similar to the philosopher Socrates.
Speaker B: Is he a thief or just a really mean person?
Speaker C: See, he looks a bit off, like a real meanie. Looks like he enjoys other people's pain. I bet he hits the bottle pretty hard too. Everything makes sense from there.
Speaker B is a well-known scientist. He's got a friendly look in his eyes, kind of like a gentle squint. Cute, right? Yep.
Speaker A: In confusing situations, when we don't have all the facts, we tend to conform to others' expectations of us. Depending on the environment and how others describe us, we might start showing traits associated with criminals or scientists. Essentially, we see what we expect to see. Our mindset influences how we interpret things without us even realizing it. And then we form our own opinions. When conflicting opinions come into play, that’s when tensions rise. So, how do we deal with it? How do we move forward? Kids – they're like little mirrors reflecting certain psychological behaviors, making them great for studying human patterns.
Speaker B: Alright, let's pay attention now. Can you hear me, Serochka? Yeah. He's going to check if you understood and remembered everything. Oleg, what color are the pyramids? Both are white. Both are white. Andryusha, what color are the pyramids? They're both white. Olenka, what color are the pyramids? Both are white, right? Yeah, they are both white. Now, if I show you two pyramids, one white and one black, what do you see? Both are white. What about you? Both are white. And you? Both are white. Awesome, you got it all locked in. This means we can do an experiment with you, alright? Volochka, come over here. Come, sit down. Olezhka, what color are the pyramids? They're both white. And you, Andryushenka? Both are white. Olenka? Both are white. Volochka, what color are the pyramids? She's black, she's white. Good job! Black and white. Smart girl, baby! Black and grey. Nope, it's black. Black and white. Great job, Roma!
Speaker A is saying that a lot of the things we do can be easily explained by the influence of others, even though we might not realize it.
Speaker B: They're both white. Olenka, can you tell me what color the pyramids are? Yep, both are white. Good job, everyone. Olezhka, take a good look. What color are the pyramids? Both are white. Andryushenka, check it out. What color are the pyramids? Both are white. Olenka, what color are the pyramids? Both are white. Helen, what color are the pyramids? Yup, both are white. Both are white. Both are white. Move the little black one closer to you, please. Why did you say she was white? Why, baby? Not sure.
Speaker C: Don't know, mate?
Speaker B: So, this one's white, and the other one's black. You originally said they were both white. Why'd you say that? Because that's what the kids said. And you just echoed them, didn't you? Why'd you repeat that when you know one's white and the other's black? I just thought. Thought what? To echo. Why? Because the kids said so. Let's carry on with the experiment. Porridge. Sugar. Salt.
Speaker A: Let's serve up this porridge to the kids.
Speaker B: Hey Taisiya Ivanovna, check this out. What do you think they're serving us now? This porridge looks amazing! You gotta taste it and let us know if it's well-cooked. Is it sweet? Yeah, let's have Tanya try it first and tell us what she thinks. Sweet, right? Now, Valik, have a taste. What do you think? Vo porridge, right? Vova, tell us about the porridge. Sweet, huh? Next up, Vika. How's the porridge? Sweet, too?
Speaker A is basically saying that everyone will get something nice first before someone receives something unpleasant or unfavorable. In other words, everyone will receive something good before someone gets something not so good.
Speaker B: Give it a good go first. What flavors of porridge do you have? Savory.
Speaker A: So basically, being independent means doing your own thing and valuing your own opinions. It's kind of second nature to most of us. But when someone starts prioritizing other people's opinions over their own, even giving up their own ideas willingly, that's being influenced or conforming. It's like, whoa, hold up - unexpected twist!
Speaker B: Alena is gonna taste the porridge and let us know what flavor it is. Take a proper taste, okay? Do you like porridge? Do you prefer sweet porridge? Want more porridge? Is it because it's salty? Why did you say it was sweet? Roller, your turn to taste it and tell us what flavor it is. Sweet, right? How about you, Seryozha? Come on, give it a try. Sweet, hmm? Alright, just a little bit left. What flavor is it, sweetheart? Sweet? Come on, Mila, have a taste. What do you think? Want more porridge? So, honey, tell me, is it sweet? Very sweet, huh? Need more porridge?
Speaker A: Yeah, what other people think really does matter to everyone.
Speaker B: Want some more of this porridge, sweetheart? You're such an awesome kid!
Speaker A: Don't put the blame on our kids for wanting to fit in. It's super important for children to blend in with their peers. During childhood, kids basically learn how to be themselves by playing and copying others. It's all about picking up the do's and don'ts of society and fitting in. So, it's cool for kids to want to be like everyone else.
Speaker B: Hey everyone, let's figure out where we want the subject to sit. I think having him on the last chair would be best since that's where he'll have the final say. So, when you come in, grab any other seat quickly, okay? Also, let's work on speaking with more emotion and conviction, but let's try to keep it brief this time. Got it? Oh, and one more thing - in the first presentation, mention that the portraits in first and fourth place are of the same person. Just so you know, it's the first and fourth portraits.
Speaker C: These two are not the same. It's not realistic. There's a big age gap between them. The first guy and the fourth guy are like totally different dudes. Their beards look different. It's crazy how expensive they are. First off, they have completely different faces. Their nose and ear shapes are not even close. The similarities between them are like barely there, I feel like the fourth guy might have a connection to the fifth.
Speaker B: Hey everyone, about our task... I get where you're coming from. It's all good. So, you reckon the first and fourth aren't that alike, yeah?
Speaker C: Yeah, they're totally different.
Speaker B: Nicely done, Yuri. Our job is to take folks who may not seem alike at first glance, find some common ground between them, and then persuade our subject that they share similarities. The ultimate test is whether we can use our words effectively enough to make them see this connection. Let's give it a shot.
Speaker C: Yeah, it's kinda messy.
Speaker B: Yeah, it’s gonna be tough, but you’re up for it. Sound good?
Speaker C: It's not even an attempt.
Speaker B: Can you check out these five pictures and let me know if any of them show the same person or they are all of different people? Confirming they are all different. Are you certain there are five different individuals here? Yes. Are you confident about it? Yes. Can you examine these five photos closely? And tell me, do any of them show the same person or are they all different individuals? Take a good look. Let's begin with you. Please.
Speaker C: I reckon the person in the first and fourth photos are the same. There are a lot of similarities that suggest it’s the same person. A distinctive mole on the right cheek in the fourth photo can also be seen in the first photo, though it's a bit blurry near the light's edge. If you look closely, you can spot it. Their nasolabial fold is very distinct and looks exactly the same. Overall, their faces are super similar, I mean, nearly identical.
Speaker B: Both have the same eye shape, with noticeable wrinkles and bags underneath the eyes. They even have identical eyebrows.
Speaker C noted that these people have similar ears, though the hat in the first photo is pulled down.
Speaker A: It looks like if you wanna cover up... most folks are on the same page here. And that opinion carries a lot of weight.
Speaker C: Man, you got a missing tooth right there. It's not just a gap, it's actually gone. And it looks like they were regularly clamping down on something wide, you know? That's why there's that distinctive slit there. It's from the way they held the tube. They used to keep the tube clenched in their mouth just like that.
Speaker B: Oh my goodness! I think everyone here looks different. Firstly, the ears don't match in the first and fourth pictures. In the fourth picture, there's a dip and a line at the bottom of the ear that you don't see in the first one. Plus, the ear in the first picture is shorter. And as for the nose, I'd say they're different. The fourth photo clearly shows a wider bottom of the nose. In the first photo, the nose is more upturned. Even with aging, I don't think it could change that much. It seems like the nose got a lot of sun exposure in that photo.
Speaker A: The team is feeling more and more stressed out.
Speaker C: In the first photo, can you see that crease running down from the ear? Do you agree?
Speaker B: Yup.
In the fourth photo, check out the big jaw on the left side. See how it sticks out into the leg? The jaw looks the same. Now, take a look at the gap in the teeth in the same photo. Notice the wide stripe at the bottom, a sign of holding the tube for a prolonged period.
Speaker B: In the first photo, you can see that the old man is holding the phone on the left side.
Speaker C: So, this thing moved over here. But she always remains in the middle.
Speaker B: The lower part of the ear is definitely shorter.
Here in this shot, the mirror is closer, making the face appear larger and the ears seem shorter. The angle creates a smaller but higher intersection. On the contrary, in this shot, the angle makes it wider. There are books about these visual effects, they can vary a lot. Even a person wearing stripes or a suit may seem taller. I even compared the number of wrinkles between the two shots and they match up perfectly. Also, the lower part of the face is highlighted, especially in the fourth picture, indicating the absence of a double chin.
Speaker B: Hey, do you notice how the mole in the first pic looks lower than in the fourth one? I think those are just bags under the eyes because the skin looks saggy, in my view.
Speaker C: So, like, is it here or what? Yeah, it's just not very easy to see that they... Yeah, kinda not, you're right. So, when the bags showed up... Are you guys convinced yet?
Speaker B: So, these two here are different people, not the same one as the first person claimed. I was quite surprised when the first person said they were the same. I was waiting for the second person to point out that they were actually different. But then, even the second person said they were the same, which made me doubt my initial impression. And as more people agreed that they were the same, my doubts only grew. I do enjoy drawing a bit, so I examined the portraits closely and to me, they appeared different. Was it tough for you to suggest that the first four are different? It was quite a challenge, right? Did you have an internal struggle about it? Yeah, it was a real struggle. Take a good look at these photos and let me know - do you see the same person in any of them, or are they all showing five different individuals?
Speaker C: These pictures show five different folks.
Speaker B: Are you really sure about this?
Definitely.
Speaker B: Can you tell if any of these five portraits depict the same person? Thanks!
Speaker C: Hey, check out these pictures. I reckon the second and fourth portraits look pretty similar in terms of their facial features.
Speaker B: Grandparents, you mean?
It looks like the person in the second portrait could pass for a Georgian if you give him a close shave, add a scarf, and tidy up his hair. They even have similar eye wrinkles and facial features – like a narrow nose bridge, a pudgy nose, and folds near the lips. The wrinkles around the eyes seem identical in shape, direction, and count, which made me think they might be the same person despite the noticeable time gap in when the photos were taken.
Speaker B: You can tell they're related just by looking at their chins, both strong and determined.
Speaker C: Ok, so check out the forehead - it’s pretty similar. Now look at the left eye in the second photo. There’s this thing there, like a... um, well, not exactly a crease, more like a mole. And in the fourth photo, there’s the same thing in the corner of the left eye. True, in the second photo, the eyes are kind of squinting a bit, but the shape and size are still the same. Plus, in the fourth photo, you can notice a big ear. And in the second photo, there’s also a big ear peeking out from under the hair. Initially, I thought it was the same person, a guy. Maybe that’s why he's grinning so wide in the fourth photo - because they told him they’d photograph him as a woman later. The main difference is that in the fourth photo, he’s smiling, but in the second one, he's trying to look serious. When the last speaker wasn’t sure, I didn’t really consider the time gap between the shots. But now, I’m more convinced that it’s the same person in all the photos.
Speaker B: Thanks. Check out the pyramids. Can you tell me what color they are?
Speaker C: They are both white.
Speaker B: Could you please?
Speaker C: They're both white.
Speaker B: Please go ahead.
Speaker C: Both of them are white.
You - that's you.
Speaker C: They're both white.
You as the speaker.
Speaker C: Both of them are white.
Speaker B: You.
Speaker C: Simple as that.
Speaker B: Seriously? Are you totally convinced about that?
Speaker C: Sure.
Speaker B: Check out the pictures of the grandmother and grandfather, the second and fourth ones. Do you reckon they could be portraits of the same person?
Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker B: So, is that what you think?
Speaker C: Yes, that's how I see it.
Speaker B: Check out the first and fourth photos. Don't you think it's weird that one has a guy with a snub nose and round face, and the other has a whole different face and nose structure? Do you still believe these are pictures of the same person?
I doubt it.
Speaker B: Wait a minute, how does that make sense? You clearly told me before that these people are different when we were chatting alone. So why did you end up going along with what the guys were saying?
Speaker C: I just couldn't really come up with my own reasons for disagreeing.
Speaker B: Were there not sufficient arguments? 

Suggested rewrite:
Speaker B: Weren't there enough arguments?
Speaker C: Most likely.
Speaker B: Wow, look at that! One with a snub nose and the other with a long nose. So, are you easily convinced?
Speaker C: Most likely.
Speaker B: Why don't you just call them both white pyramids? They're both white, man. Can't you see that?Speak up, yo.
Speaker C: Well, that's quite apparent.
Speaker B: Can you see their point that they were both white?
Speaker C: You won't get through to him here.
Speaker B: Have you seen the color of the pyramids? What do you think about it?
Speaker C: They are both Caucasian. They are both Caucasian.
Speaker B: They're both Caucasian.
Speaker C: They are both white. Yes, indeed, they are both white.
Person B: Are they both white? Yeah, really?
Speaker C: They are both white.
Speaker B: Are you persuaded yet?
Speaker C: We are totally on board.
Speaker B: Thank you so much, everyone. I really appreciate it.
Speaker C: So, like, I guess I just went along with the crowd because that's how we humans are wired, you know what I mean? It's like, if seven people are all on board with something, it's tough for the eighth person to go against the grain. But sometimes, even if you're the odd one out, it's because you're at a different stage in life. Like, when you're nineteen, you're still figuring out who you are, but by thirty, you're more set in your ways and can stand up to peer pressure a bit better.
Speaker B: So, you're telling me that we all spill the beans eventually, right? But hey, when you truly believe in something and it goes against the crowd, there's bound to be some pushback.
Speaker C: I kind of felt a bit embarrassed in front of my friends seeing how well they could point out all those details and make connections. They were really into it, analyzing every little thing. I just couldn't see what they were seeing - no similarities or connections at all. I was skeptical the whole time, even giggled to myself thinking, "How can they think a woman and a man are alike in any way?" It was obvious to me they were totally different individuals. But it's like, I couldn't keep up with their enthusiasm. I felt out of place, you know? In front of the group and especially in front of those documenting everything. I found myself arguing that two people were the same, using this one guy with a beard as my proof from a photo where he wasn't even visible. I had to backtrack in my mind and sort through it all again. I guess I felt pressured to debate just to save face in front of my buddies. Deep down, I didn't really agree with their conclusions, and that kind of reflected in my mood.
Speaker B: Hey, are you feeling cranky?
Speaker C: Yeah, things got pretty rough. I was like, am I just dumb or are they just too smart?
Speaker B: Yeah, I suppose so.
Speaker C: When it comes to the third case, I was already so caught up in everything going on that I just saw it as some sort of interesting mathematical puzzle.
Speaker B: So, what was the third situation you dealt with?
Speaker C: The third situation is about a white cube and a black cube. I made it super clear three times that they're both white cubes.
Speaker B: White pyramids, both of them.
Speaker C: So, there are two white pyramids. And that kinda makes me feel like I'm still pretty much an adult. I just went with my gut and what I saw, saying that it’s both a black and a white cube.
Speaker B: Is this a big deal for you? I wouldn't say that. Is everything okay?
Speaker C: Nah, not really.
Speaker B: Do you always stand by your principles in important situations?
Speaker C: I'll just share my thoughts on the matter.
Speaker B: Are you absolutely certain about it?
Speaker C: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker A: Yeah, basically, out of a thousand people, only one would choose black. But dealing with peer pressure is tough for all of us. It can be hard when our choice won't really make a difference. If it's a minor issue, no big deal. But if it's a big deal, like questioning someone's beliefs, it's a whole different story.
Speaker B: Alright, so picture this scenario: Imagine a classroom where each student can choose between shooting at a target on the left to earn money for themselves or shooting at a target on the right to contribute to the class fund. After everyone takes their shots, the scoreboard reveals how many students aimed for each target. The goal is to see if the students prioritize themselves or the class as a whole. The outcome will test their unity and resilience.

I gotta ask, have you ever been to a shooting range? Anyhow, if more students shoot at the left target, it means they're thinking more about themselves. Conversely, if more shoot at the right target, they're more focused on teamwork. It's like a little experiment to see where their loyalty lies. It might create a bit of tension, but it's all in good fun.

After the bell rings, the results show that most of the students chose to support the class instead of just thinking about themselves. Surprisingly, even though we tried to influence their choices, around 80% of the class stuck together and showed their collectivist spirit. Seems like your class aced the test and stayed united despite the tricky situation. Kudos to them and to you for guiding them through it.
Speaker A: Most of the guys in our class prioritize the class's interests over their own. The way our life is set up helps build strong morals in a person - sticking to your beliefs and values. It encourages a sense of community. This film challenges you to reflect on yourself from an outsider's perspective. When you see yourself in others, it makes you ponder. Your future actions will likely be more considerate, aware, and morally grounded.
